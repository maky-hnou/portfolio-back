about.txt,about,0,"I am Hani YOUSFI, a contemplative coder and analyst inspired by tough problems. My interests span across Data, Complex Adaptive Systems, and Cognitive Modeling.
Currently, I hold the position of Data Engineer at Klarna, where my work revolves around data modeling, designing and constructing data pipelines, and managing data warehousing. My primary goal is to make data readily available and accessible to Data Scientists and Business Analysts.
I am also known as an enthusiastic Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for cutting-edge technologies and a knack for solving real-world problems. With 3 years of experience in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing, I've had the privilege of collaborating with international clients across diverse domains such as E-Business, Sports, Healthcare, and Robotics. My forte lies in developing high-quality solutions that streamline operations and boost revenue. I'm a highly skilled team member capable of delivering end-to-end AI solutions utilizing the latest technologies in the field.
My journey into coding began through various courses, primarily online, supplemented by the vast knowledge repository of StackOverflow and invaluable experiences gained from contributing to Open Source projects. Each project I've been a part of has enriched me with new skills and insights.
Most importantly, I have an insatiable thirst for learning. Every day, I make it a point to delve into something new, whether it's related to my work or any other intriguing topic that catches my attention.
I started as a Network Engineering Student, but my insatiable curiosity led me towards Artificial Intelligence. I embarked on my academic journey by completing my graduation internship at Novel-Ti, a Tunisian startup, where I delved deeper into AI and Computer Vision.
In September 2018, I transitioned into a full-time role as an R&D Engineer at Novel-Ti. Here, I contributed to the development of AI and Computer Vision solutions addressing real-world challenges.
In August 2021, I took my first international professional step as a Machine Learning and IT consultant at Aigometri AB. I played a pivotal role in an internal project, taking charge of the AI and Computer Vision components while aiding in the creation of a testing platform.
Additionally, I worked as a Software Engineer Consultant for one of Europe's largest fintech companies, Klarna. My role was centered around building integrations with third-party systems and implementing automations to enhance team efficiency and performance.
May 2022 marked the beginning of my third career phase when I assumed the role of Data Engineer at Klarna. This experience unveiled my passion for working with data, encompassing data modeling, ETL pipeline design and implementation, and data warehousing management.
A few interesting things about me: I have a deep love for Russian Literature, with Fyodor Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" being my favorite. I also enjoy playing vintage strategic video games.
"
education.txt,education,1,"I pursued my academic journey by completing a Preparatory Diploma for Engineering Studies at the Faculty of Sciences of Monastir, spanning from September 2012 to June 2015. This is similar to a bachelor degree but it is conculded with passing the National Competitive Exam for Engineering Schools.
Following that, I furthered my education by earning a Masters in Network Engineering at the National School of Electronics and Telecommunications of Sfax, where I studied from September 2015 to July 2018. This academic pursuit allowed me to delve deeper into the field of network engineering and telecommunications, expanding my knowledge and skills in this domain.
