My first experience was as an R&D Engineer at Novel-Ti, Tunisia, from September 2018 to July 2021, where I worked on several advanced AI and computer vision projects. These included developing a Deep Learning OCR system, a Real-Time Goal Line Detection System, autonomous robot navigation algorithms, body parts detection models for video games aimed at children with special needs, and a comprehensive text analysis system.
