I pursued my academic journey by completing a Preparatory Diploma for Engineering Studies at the Faculty of Sciences of Monastir, spanning from September 2012 to June 2015. This is similar to a bachelor degree but it is conculded with passing the National Competitive Exam for Engineering Schools.
Following that, I furthered my education by earning a Masters in Telecommunications Engineering at the National School of Electronics and Telecommunications of Sfax, where I studied from September 2015 to July 2018. This academic pursuit allowed me to delve deeper into the field of networks engineering and telecommunications, expanding my knowledge and skills in this domain.
