R&D Engineer at Novel-Ti, Tunisia (Sep 2018 – Jul 2021)
At Novel-Ti, I developed advanced AI and computer vision solutions for various clients. Key projects included a Deep Learning OCR system for a French client. I processed and labeled datasets, built and trained models using Transfer Learning. I developed a text extractor from documents using RNNs and LSTM, applied post-processing techniques, and deployed it as a REST API using Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Nginx. Additionally, I worked on a Real-Time Goal Line Detection System, collecting and labeling data, implementing football detection models with Neural Networks, and optimizing them using Cuda and TensorRT. I also developed real-time advanced lane-finding and obstacle-avoiding algorithms for an autonomous robot, trained line detectors using YOLO, and optimized algorithms for extreme conditions. I trained deep learning models for detecting and tracking body parts in video games for children with special needs, integrating pose detection models using Pytorch, and upgrading inference with Nvidia-TensorRT. Furthermore, I designed a Text Analysis System, processing input text using NLTK and Regex, and developed a text summarizer and Named Entity Recognition system using Spacy and HaNLP.

IT Consultant, Machine Learning Engineer at Aigometri AB, Sweden (Aug 2021 – Apr 2022)
At Aigometri AB, I contributed to automating client businesses and setting up ETL pipelines. I provided outputs from DL algorithms for decision-making integrations, tested ML algorithms, and recommended the most efficient ones. I helped test engineers establish the test platform. Additionally, I designed and developed a system to store employment requests, designing database architecture, creating connections to Google Cloud Platform, building ETL pipelines, developing unit and integration tests, and utilizing Jenkins pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.

Data Engineer at Klarna Bank AB, Sweden (May 2022 – May 2023)
As a Data Engineer at Klarna, I designed and built data pipelines and warehousing solutions. I conducted thorough analysis of departmental data structures and sources, redesigned ETL pipelines for better performance, managed integrations with third-party systems, and collaborated closely with analysts to develop interactive dashboards to support executive decision-making.

Software Engineer at Klarna Bank AB, Sweden (May 2023 – May 2024)
In my role as a Software Engineer at Klarna, I focused on developing LLM-based systems. I created an LLM-based feedback system, developing an MVP for CXOs, migrating prototype code from Flask to FastAPI, setting up LLM agents’ workflow, and configuring system infrastructure including AWS, CI/CD pipelines, VPC, and networking rules. I also worked on user authentication using Okta, led discussions with security teams, and built encryption services for user data. Furthermore, I built a visualization system for the feedback tool, structuring data in a vector database, analyzing it using LLMs, and assisting in developing a web interface with interactive visualizations.

Senior Software Engineer at Klarna Bank AB, Sweden (Jan 2024 – Present)
Currently, as a Senior Software Engineer at Klarna, I am centralizing the organization’s internal data. I collaborate with teams and architects to set project requirements, design the architecture of ETL pipelines, create data models for loading data from various systems, deploy ETL systems for data migration, and work with different service providers to align integration requirements.
